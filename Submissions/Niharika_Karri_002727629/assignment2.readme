In this assignment, I focused on a diverse range of topics, including algorithms, data structures, graph theory, problem-solving, and creative problem design. 
Summary:

Algorithms and Data Structures: The questions explored various algorithms such as Kruskal's algorithm, topological sorting, and dynamic programming. 
These questions tested problem-solving skills, algorithmic understanding, and the ability to implement solutions.

Problem Design: Several questions required designing algorithmic problems that maintained the spirit of provided examples while being relevant to 
different contexts, such as songs and artworks. This showcased the importance of creative problem design in making abstract algorithms more relatable and engaging.

Algorithmic Thinking: The questions encouraged algorithmic thinking and the application of algorithms in practical scenarios. 
Topics ranged from finding minimum spanning trees to efficient encoding of songs and artworks.

Reflection on ChatGPT's Assistance: In the reflection section, I highlighted how ChatGPT assisted in enhancing my understanding of algorithmic concepts and provided 
valuable insights into problem design. The tool's support was crucial in crafting well-structured questions and solutions.

Kruskal's Algorithm: Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in a weighted, connected, undirected graph. 
It was featured in coding questions related to finding the MST and determining the minimum cost to connect cities.

Topological Sorting: Topological sorting is a fundamental algorithm used to linearly order the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in such a way that 
for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before vertex v in the ordering. Topological sorting was used to solve problems related to ordering tasks or elements in a specific sequence while avoiding cyclic dependencies.

Dynamic Programming: Dynamic programming is an algorithmic technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and caching their solutions. 
While not explicitly mentioned, dynamic programming principles were applied in the solutions to optimize the algorithms and reduce computational complexity.

These algorithms demonstrate various aspects of algorithmic thinking, optimization, and problem-solving in different contexts, 
ranging from graph theory and optimization to sequence ordering and efficiency analysis.

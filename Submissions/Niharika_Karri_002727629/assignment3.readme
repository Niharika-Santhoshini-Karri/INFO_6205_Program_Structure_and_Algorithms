The assignment consists of a series of questions related to various algorithmic concepts, including the Master Theorem, dynamic programming, and graph theory. Here's a summary of the questions and their key points:

In this assignment, we tackled various algorithmic and mathematical problems, covering a range of topics 
including flow networks, recurrence relations, and the Master Theorem. 

1. Max-Flow Problem: We started by understanding the concepts of max-flow, cut sets, min-cut, and network flow. Max-flow problems are essential in solving real-world scenarios like disaster management.

2. Polynomial- Time Algorithm: We applied the Polynomial-Time Algorithm to find the maximum flow in a directed graph. The algorithm involves finding augmenting paths to optimize flow.

3. Algorithm for Reducing Flow: We considered a scenario where we had to reduce the capacity of a flow network by deleting a subset of edges while maintaining a minimum s-t cut. We formulated a polynomial-time algorithm to achieve this.

4. Dynamic Programming with Recurrence Relations: We explored dynamic programming and recurrence relations. This included finding optimal store locations along a street to maximize profit while adhering to adjacency constraints.

5. Master Theorem:  delved into the Master Theorem, a powerful tool for analyzing and solving recurrence relations in algorithm design. This involved understanding the three cases and applying the theorem to challenging recurrence relations.

This assignment covered diverse topics, from network optimization to dynamic programming and algorithm analysis. These concepts play a crucial role in solving complex real-world problems, making them valuable skills for computer science and mathematics.

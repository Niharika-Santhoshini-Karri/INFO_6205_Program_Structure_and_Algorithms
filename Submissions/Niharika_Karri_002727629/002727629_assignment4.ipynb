    "Solution Approach: Use a variation of the shortest path algorithm that accounts for disjointness, such as Suurballe's algorithm, to find individual paths. Modify the graph after finding each path to prevent future paths from reusing nodes of already found paths. Sum the costs of the paths to get the total cost. NP-Completeness Proof: This problem is in NP since given a set of paths, we can easily calculate the total cost and verify that paths are disjoint in polynomial time. It's NP-hard because even deciding if there exists a set of disjoint paths (without considering cost) is the Directed Disjoint Paths Problem, which is NP-complete."

Conversely, any solution to this problem with C(v)=1 constraints is also a solution to the original problem. Complexity: Checking if a solution is valid (i.e., paths are disjoint and respect vertex capacities) can be done in polynomial time, confirming the problem is in NP. The reduction shows NP-hardness"

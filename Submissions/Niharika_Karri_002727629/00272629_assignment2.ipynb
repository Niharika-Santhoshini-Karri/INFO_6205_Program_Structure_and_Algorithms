    "1. **Identify Unique Elements:** Analyze each artwork in the series and identify the unique elements introduced in each artwork compared to the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encode Unique Elements:** Encode only the unique elements introduced in each artwork, specifying their position, properties, or characteristics. We do not need to reiterate the common elements already present in the previous artworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use References:** Instead of encoding all details of a common element in every artwork, use references or placeholders to refer back to the original description of that element. This way, you can avoid redundant descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Optimize Descriptions:** Optimize the descriptions of new elements to minimize their length while retaining their essence.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Concatenate Descriptions:** Concatenate the descriptions of unique elements from all artworks to create the final script.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this approach, the script length 'f(n)' will be significantly smaller than if we were to encode every detail of every artwork separately. The growth of 'f(n)' will be as slow as possible because it depends mainly on the number of unique elements introduced in the series and their descriptions, rather than duplicating the entire content of previous artworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This efficient encoding allows viewers to understand and appreciate the progression of the artworks while minimizing the script's length, making it an effective way to convey the essence of the artistic series."

    "Learning About Problem Design:\n",
    "Designing algorithmic problems involves not only understanding the underlying concepts but also framing them in a way that challenges problem solvers effectively. I learned that presenting problems in real-world contexts, as demonstrated in the examples, can make abstract algorithms more relatable and interesting. Additionally, it's essential to balance complexity, clarity, and brevity in problem statements to make them accessible yet intellectually stimulating.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process highlighted the versatility of algorithmic concepts and the importance of adapting them to different scenarios. It also reinforced the idea that effective problem design involves bridging the gap between abstract algorithms and practical applications to engage and challenge problem solvers."
